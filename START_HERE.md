## 🎨 What You'll See

When you run the simulation:

**Green Background** = Energy (food)
- Brighter = more energy
- Black = no energy

**Colored Circles** = Organisms
- Color = genetic lineage (family)
- Size = energy level
- Position = location

**Bottom Panel** = Statistics
- Population count
- Births and deaths
- Average energy
- Total world energy

## 🧬 Evolution Stages

### Stage 1: Chaos (Ticks 0-100)
- Most organisms die quickly
- Random movement
- Population crashes

### Stage 2: Adaptation (Ticks 100-1000)
- Survivors have better genes
- Energy-seeking emerges
- Population stabilizes

### Stage 3: Stability (Ticks 1000-10000)
- Optimized strategies
- Genetic diversity
- Stable ecosystems

### Stage 4: Complexity (Ticks 10000+)
- Novel behaviors
- Ecological balance
- Foundation for Phase 2

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Phase 1 ✅ (Current)
- [x] Organisms survive and reproduce
- [x] Population stabilizes
- [x] Genetic diversity emerges
- [x] Behavioral adaptation visible

### Phase 2 (Next)
- [ ] Predator-prey cycles
- [ ] Communication protocols
- [ ] Multiple ecological niches
- [ ] Learning within lifetime

### Ultimate Goal
- [ ] General intelligence emerges
- [ ] Autonomous goal-setting
- [ ] Consciousness indicators
- [ ] Open-ended evolution

## 🔐 Safety

**This is safe to run:**
- ✅ Sandboxed (no file/network access)
- ✅ Limited (population caps)
- ✅ Monitored (full logging)
- ✅ Controlled (emergency stops)
- ✅ Transparent (open source)

Organisms exist only in simulation memory. They cannot escape.

- 📋 A clear roadmap (5 phases)
- 🎯 A concrete plan (tasks.md)
- 🔬 A scientific approach (documented)
- 🚀 The determination to find out

**Let's see what emerges.**

## 📍 Where to Go From Here

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. ✅ Run `python main.py` (if you haven't)
2. ✅ Read VISION.md (understand the why)
3. ✅ Read ROADMAP.md (see the journey)
4. ✅ Run long experiment (10,000+ ticks)
5. ✅ Document in RESEARCH_LOG.md

## 🎯 Remember

**This is not a weekend project.**

This is a research expedition into uncharted territory.

**We're not building AI.**

We're creating the conditions for AI to build itself.

**Success is not guaranteed.**

But the journey will teach us more about intelligence than any textbook.

---

## 🧬 Let's Begin

```bash
python main.py
```

**The digital biosphere is alive.**
**Evolution is running.**
**Let's see what emerges.**
