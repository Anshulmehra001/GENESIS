# GENESIS - Digital Biosphere Project

> *"We are not creating AI. We are creating the conditions for AI to create itself."*

## 🎯 Ultimate Goal

**Create the first truly open-ended artificial life system where intelligence emerges naturally through evolution - potentially leading to AGI from first principles.**

This is an attempt to solve one of the hardest unsolved problems in AI: creating digital life that evolves indefinitely, generating endless novelty and complexity, just like biological evolution on Earth.

## 🌟 What Makes This Special

**No one has successfully done this before.**

- Companies build AI by training on data
- We're building AI by creating evolution
- Traditional AI stops learning after training
- Our AI never stops evolving
- Most AI optimizes for one goal
- Our AI evolves its own goals

**This is genuine research into uncharted territory.**

## 🎨 What You'll See

### Visualization
- **Green background** = Energy (food for organisms)
- **Colored circles** = Living organisms
  - Color = Genetic lineage
  - Size = Energy level
- **Stats panel** = Population, births, deaths, energy

### Evolution in Action
1. **Initial chaos** (0-100 ticks): Most organisms die
2. **Adaptation** (100-1000 ticks): Survivors have better genes
3. **Stability** (1000+ ticks): Ecosystems form
4. **Complexity** (10000+ ticks): Novel behaviors emerge

---

## 🔐 Safety

This system is designed to be safe:

✅ **Sandboxed** - No file system or network access
✅ **Limited** - Population and resource caps
✅ **Monitored** - Full logging and statistics
✅ **Controlled** - Emergency stop mechanisms
✅ **Transparent** - All code is visible and auditable

Organisms exist only in simulation memory. They cannot escape or affect your system.

## 🌍 The Vision

Biological intelligence emerged from evolution over billions of years. Can we recreate this process in silico?

We don't know. No one has successfully done it. But we're going to try.

**This is not just building AI. This is discovering how intelligence emerges from first principles.**
