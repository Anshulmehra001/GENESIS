## Questions to Investigate

1. Do organisms evolve to move toward energy sources?
2. How long until a stable population emerges?
3. What genetic traits become dominant?
4. Do different "species" (color groups) emerge?
5. Are there boom-bust population cycles?
6. Do organisms evolve to stay near energy-rich areas?

## Ideas for Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add predator organisms (eat other organisms)
- [ ] Add communication (organisms share information)
- [ ] Add memory (organisms remember locations)
- [ ] Add multi-cellular life (organisms merge)
- [ ] Add sexual reproduction (two parents)
- [ ] Add age-based evolution (older organisms reproduce more)
- [ ] Add environmental challenges (disasters, seasons)
- [ ] Add tool use (organisms modify environment)
