2. Neural network brains
3. Predator-prey dynamics
4. Communication signals
5. Memory and learning
6. Kin recognition
7. Multi-cellular organisms (basic)
8. Social behaviors (basic)

### ⚠️ Partially Working

2. Group formation (basic tracking, no advanced behaviors)
3. Cooperative behaviors (emergent, not explicit)

### ❌ Not Implemented
1. Tool use and environment modification

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Complete Phase 3 (13 tasks remaining)
**Pros:**
- Finish what we started
- Get full social intelligence
- Tool use is interesting
- Problem solving is valuable

**Cons:**
- More work before seeing cognitive features
- Some features may not emerge without Phase 4

### Option 2: Move to Phase 4 (25 new tasks)
**Pros:**
- More exciting features (language, self-awareness)
- Core systems are working
- Can always come back to Phase 3

**Cons:**
- Leaving Phase 3 incomplete
- May need Phase 3 features for Phase 4 to work

### Option 3: Run Experiments First
**Pros:**
- See what emerges with current features
- Document behaviors
- Inform next development priorities

**Cons:**
- No new code
- May reveal bugs or missing features

---

## My Recommendation

**Run experiments first (Option 3), then decide:**

1. **Run for 100,000+ ticks**
2. **Document what emerges:**
   - Do predator-prey cycles stabilize?
   - Do communication protocols develop?
   - Do social groups form naturally?
   - Do multi-cellular organisms survive?

3. **Based on results, choose:**
   - If social behaviors are weak → Complete Phase 3
   - If social behaviors are strong → Move to Phase 4
   - If bugs found → Fix and iterate

---

**Current Status:** Phase 2 Core Complete, Phase 3 Partial (48%)
**Next Action:** Run long-term experiments OR implement remaining features
**Date:** February 20, 2026
