- Insight (recognize patterns)
- Planning (multi-step solutions)
- Transfer learning across puzzle types

### Social Hierarchy
- **Ranks:** 0 = leader, higher = lower rank
- **Roles:** leader, scout, guard, follower

## 🧬 How It All Works Together

### Example Organism Lifecycle

1. **Birth** - Organism spawns with neural network brain
2. **Sensing** - Uses directional vision cone to detect energy/predators
3. **Memory** - Remembers high-energy locations
4. **Movement** - Neural network decides direction based on inputs
5. **Social** - Recognizes kin, joins hierarchy
6. **Role** - Assigned role (leader/scout/guard/follower)
7. **Tools** - May create tools to enhance abilities
8. **Structures** - May build shelter or storage
9. **Puzzles** - Encounters and solves puzzles for rewards
10. **Communication** - Emits signals to warn kin
11. **Reproduction** - Creates offspring with mutated brain
12. **Death** - Energy depleted or old age

### Emergent Behaviors to Watch For

**Short-term (0-1000 ticks):**
- Predators hunt with directional sensing
- Prey flee using vision cones
- Organisms build first structures
- Simple puzzles solved by trial and error

**Medium-term (1000-10000 ticks):**
- Social hierarchies form
- Leaders emerge and guide groups
- Scouts explore, guards protect
- Tools and structures become common
- Insight learning develops

**Long-term (10000+ ticks):**
- Complex social structures
- Cultural transmission of tool use
- Sophisticated problem-solving strategies
- Multi-cellular organisms with specialized cells
- Stable ecosystems with multiple niches
